# gcc, gcc-c++, python3.12-devel, rust and cargo are build-only tools needed
# to compile Python packages from source (pydantic-core, uvloop, httptools,
# watchfiles, greenlet, ...). gcc-c++ is required for C++ extensions (greenlet).
# python3.12-devel (not python3-devel) is required because this base image
# ships python3.12 directly, not the RHEL9 default python3 (3.9).

# which build-backend sdists to prefetch, so `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# below can resolve them from the offline index during a hermetic build.
